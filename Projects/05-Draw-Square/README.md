# What it is
Developed code in Python for learning about classes.

Each shape is a different function.
- drawSquare
- drawCrazySquareCircle
- drawTriangle
- drawCrazyFlower
- etc...

The Classes: A class is a template for functions and variables, which we can call objects, organized in a way that the programmer does not have to re code it again every time.

Only 1 class: Turtle
Several instances: some_tutrle, brad, angie, zelda
