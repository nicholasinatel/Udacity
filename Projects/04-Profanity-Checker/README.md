## QuickStart
Windows Install
- [Python 2.7.15](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2715/)

## How to execute: 

Go to project Folder, Open Terminal, Type:
```
    python check_profanity.py
```
You have to write the .txt file yourself, allthough already comes with an example.

## Configuration
- Enter text file in ```quotes``` variable.


## Libraries
- [urllib](https://docs.python.org/2/library/urllib.html) 

## How it works
Once you execute the code, with the proper text file, it will open the text file and answer if it has curse words or not.

## Known Bugs
I have not tested on MAC OS or LINUX, it should work though.
